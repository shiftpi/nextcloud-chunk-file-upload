# Nextcloud Chunk File Upload
Upload files to Nextcloud using chunks

Nextcloud offers a chunked upload library, which makes your life a lot easier, if you want to upload large files to
your Nextcloud instance over a bad network.

Use this library if you want to build some sort of upload client in node.js and do that with the joy of Promises ðŸ™Œ.

## Installation
This package is published on NPM so you can simply type:
```
npm install --save nextcloud-chunk-file-upload
```
or
```
yarn add nextcloud-chunk-file-upload
```

## Usage
### Upload
The core part of this library is a class called `Upload`, which takes care of server parameters, like the server's
address and your credentials. If you want to start an upload, call ``uploadFile``.
The return value of this method is Promise, indicating the success or failure of the upload process.
